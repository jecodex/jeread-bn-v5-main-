    question: 'What is the key to building lasting relationships?',
    answer: 'Building lasting relationships requires consistent communication, mutual respect, and genuine care for others. Trust is the foundation - it takes time to build but can be destroyed in moments. Active listening, empathy, and being present during both good and challenging times are essential. Remember that relationships are investments that require ongoing effort from both parties.',

    question: 'How can I stay motivated during difficult times?',
    answer: 'Staying motivated during tough times starts with accepting that challenges are temporary. Focus on small, achievable goals rather than overwhelming yourself with big picture thinking. Maintain your routine, connect with supportive people, and remember your why - the deeper purpose behind your goals. Practice gratitude daily and celebrate small wins. Sometimes the best thing you can do is just keep moving forward, even if it\'s just one small step at a time.',

    question: 'What\'s the most important life lesson you\'ve learned?',
    answer: 'The most valuable lesson is that life is not about avoiding failures, but learning how to recover from them. Every setback teaches us something about ourselves and makes us stronger. Embrace change, be kind to yourself, and understand that growth comes from discomfort. Your mistakes don\'t define you - how you respond to them does.',

    question: 'How do you find your purpose in life?',
    answer: 'Finding your purpose isn\'t about having a dramatic revelation - it\'s about paying attention to what energizes you and what problems you naturally want to solve. Look at your values, your strengths, and what activities make you lose track of time. Purpose often emerges from serving others and making a positive impact, no matter how small. Start with curiosity, experiment with different paths, and trust that purpose can evolve over time.',

    question: 'What advice would you give to your younger self?',
    answer: 'I would tell my younger self to worry less about what others think and focus more on personal growth. Take more risks, fail faster, and don\'t be afraid to ask for help. Invest in relationships and experiences over material things. Learn to manage money early, and understand that comparison is the thief of joy. Most importantly, be patient with yourself - life is a marathon, not a sprint.',

    question: 'আপনার দেখা সবচেয়ে underrated বই কোনটি?',
    answer: 'এই বইটা খুব বেশি লোকের পড়ার তালিকায় থাকে না, কিন্তু এর প্রতিটি অধ্যায় যেন জীবন নিয়ে একেকটা দার্শনিক উপদেশ।\n\nবইটি ছোট, সহজ ভাষায় লেখা — কিন্তু এর গভীরতা অসীম।\n\nসম্পর্ক, স্বাধীনতা, দুঃখ, আনন্দ — সবকিছু নিয়ে লেখকের দৃষ্টিভঙ্গি এমনভাবে বলা যে মনে হয়, কেউ যেন আপনার আত্মার গভীরে কথা বলছে।\n\nএটাকে আমি বলি — একটি ছোট বই, একটি বিশাল জীবনের মানে খুঁজে পাওয়ার যাত্রা।\n\nঅনেক জনপ্রিয় বই আলো পায়, কিন্তু “The Prophet” এখনো অনেকের কাছে হারিয়ে থাকা এক রত্ন।',
